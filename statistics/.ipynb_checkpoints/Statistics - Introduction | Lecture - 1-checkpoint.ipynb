    "Hi Readers,\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a set of series of chapters which would cover essential statistical topics from Data Science perspective and we would try to cover as much depth of the topic with literature, examples, visualizations and further read. \n",
    "\n",
    "You would find a great reference from two of my favorite books and few of my lecture notes to cover the breadth of the topic. You would find a great learning text from these books and we do not have intention to plagiarise their honest effort. My best approach is to summarise from various texts into one py notebook for the sole purpose to learn and revise. This notebook would serve best purpose for somebody who either needs to start with statistics for DS and for somebody who just needs to revise concepts from time to time like me.\n",

    "Statistical Learning Theory is a framework of machine learning drawing from the field of statistics and mathematics functional analysis. The prime objective of statistical learning is to find a predictive function given the data.\n",

Statistical learning theory takes the perspective that there is some unknown probability distribution over the product space $Z$ = $X$ x $Y$, i.e. there exists some unknown $p(z)=p({\\vec  {x}},y)$\n",
